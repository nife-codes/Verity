CEO INTERVIEW - MARCH 20, 2025
Interviewer: Sarah Johnson, Financial Times
Subject: Michael Chen, CEO TechCorp

[00:00:00]
INTERVIEWER: "Mr. Chen, thank you for agreeing to this interview. I want to ask you directly - when did you first learn about the potential Zenith Corp acquisition?"

[00:00:08]
CEO: "I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight. I was informed on March 15th, 2025, during our regular quarterly board meeting. That was the absolute first time I heard anything about Zenith Corp or any acquisition discussions."

[00:00:22]
INTERVIEWER: "You're certain about that date? March 15th?"

[00:00:26]
CEO: "Absolutely certain. March 15th. I remember it clearly because it was the day before my daughter's birthday party. I was completely surprised when the board brought it up. Before that meeting, I had zero knowledge of any discussions with Zenith."

[00:00:41]
INTERVIEWER: "But there are reports that preliminary meetings occurred earlier in March..."

[00:00:45]
CEO: "Those reports are inaccurate. Any meetings that may have occurred were handled by our VP of Corporate Development without my involvement or knowledge. I was not part of those conversations."

[00:00:57]
INTERVIEWER: "Thank you, Mr. Chen."
