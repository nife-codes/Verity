## 🎯 What is Verity?

Verity leverages **Gemini 3 Pro's advanced reasoning capabilities** to analyze complex forensic evidence, detect deception, and reconstruct event timelines with unprecedented accuracy. Built for legal professionals, investigators, and compliance teams.

### Key Features

- **🧠 Advanced Reasoning** - Gemini 3 Pro's thinking mode provides transparent, step-by-step analysis
- **📊 Multimodal Analysis** - Process documents, images, transcripts, and financial records simultaneously
- **⚡ Contradiction Detection** - Automatically identify conflicting claims across evidence sources
- **📅 Timeline Reconstruction** - Build precise chronologies from metadata and content analysis
- **🎨 Visual Intelligence** - Interactive contradiction maps and animated timelines
- **🔒 Evidence Integrity** - Detect tampering through metadata analysis and cross-referencing

---

## 🚀 Demo Strategy

Verity uses a **Golden Path demo system** designed for the Gemini 3 hackathon:

### Sample Evidence Mode (Recommended)

Pre-validated Gemini 3 Pro analysis from AI Studio showcasing:
- **Insider Trading Case** - CEO stock sales + acquisition timeline analysis
- Real Gemini 3 Pro thinking steps and reasoning
- High-complexity forensic scenario with MNPI (Material Non-Public Information)

**Why Sample Mode?**
- Gemini 3 Pro preview has strict rate limits
- Ensures judges can experience full capabilities without quota errors
- Demonstrates authentic Gemini 3 output validated via AI Studio

### Custom Upload Mode

Live analysis with graceful fallback:
1. Attempts Gemini 3 Pro (if quota available)
2. Falls back to Gemini 2.0 Flash if needed
3. Transparent status indicators show which model is active

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **AI**: Gemini 3 Pro via `@google/generative-ai` SDK
- **Visualization**: D3.js for contradiction maps
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom gradients

## 📸 Screenshots

### Reasoning Process
Gemini 3 Pro's step-by-step thinking mode shows transparent analysis:
- Forensic evidence analysis
- Temporal data refinement
- Contradiction evaluation
- Timeline construction

### Contradiction Map
Visual representation of conflicting claims with credibility scoring:
- Red nodes = Low credibility (self-reported claims)
- Green nodes = High credibility (documentary evidence)
- Dashed lines = Contradiction links

### Timeline Reconstruction
Chronological event sequence with confidence scores and source attribution.
